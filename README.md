## Introduction

The `NewNewsApp` is a simple yet feature-rich React Native application that fetches the latest headlines from a public news API. It demonstrates how to use React Native with TypeScript, Axios for API calls, and best practices for state management and modular architecture.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (v16 or later recommended) - [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- **npm** (comes with Node.js) or **yarn** - [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) / [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
- **Expo CLI** - (for development) [Install Expo CLI](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/installation/)
- **Android Studio** or **Xcode** (for testing on Android/iOS) - [Install Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) / [Install Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/)

## Installation Guide

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/NewNewsApp.git
   cd NewNewsApp

2. **Install dependencies**
    ```bash
   npm install
    
3. **Install Expo CLI**
    ```bash
   npm install -g expo-cli
   npx expo start


## File Structure
Each directory and file serves a specific purpose to ensure that the app remains modular, maintainable, and scalable:

- **assets/**: Stores static resources like images and icons.
- **node_modules/**: Contains installed dependencies.
- **src/components/**: Houses reusable components like `NewsCard.tsx` for rendering individual news articles.
- **src/services/**: Contains logic for API calls. In this case, `newsApi.ts` handles the fetching of news data.
- **src/types/**: TypeScript types and interfaces for defining the shape of data, such as `news.d.ts` for news data.
- **src/utils/**: Contains helper functions like `formatDate.ts` to format dates or perform other utility tasks.
- **App.tsx**: The main entry point of the application.

This structure follows modern best practices for React Native applications and should provide a solid foundation for further development.
